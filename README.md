##### How are alternative parliaments calculated in this app?
We took the election results from the last three federal elections and calculated the percentage of vote received by the Conservatives, Liberals, NDP, Bloc Québécois, and Green Party. Independent candidates and other parties were grouped together into an 'other' category. We then assigned seats to each party according the percentage of vote they received, rounding down. Any leftover seats were assigned to the party that won the most votes.

##### How are alternative voting results for parliament bills calculated?
For each bill and each party, we took the percentage of 'yes' and 'no' votes in parliament voting results, and scaled it to the number of seats the party has in the alternative government. For example, if NDP had 36 seats in the real parliament, and 80% of the party voted 'yes' on a given bill, this would translate to 80 'yes' votes and 20 'no' votes in an alternative parliament where NDP had 100  seats. The vote of the 'other' category, and any parties for which we had no data for a given parliament, was calculated from the percentages of vote in the 'other' category in the real parliament.

##### What are the limitations of this data?
Election results are affected by the electoral system because voters' choices depend in part on how likely candidates are to be elected under the current system. Additionally, the politics of a parliament depend on its composition. The results shown by this app are intended to be suggestive only, a 'what-if' scenario rather than a definitive prediction.
